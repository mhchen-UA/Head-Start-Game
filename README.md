# Head-Start-Game
2-player game on whoever presses their key first

1. Run both in IDLE

2. Click on the window to start

3. Wait until the window changes color, then press 'a' for left player, and 'b' for right player

If any player presses their key BEFORE the screen changes color, they lose. (False Start)

I made this to practice for track
